Welcome to the git repository for the Data Science Assignment of the IAI course at LUMC.

Here you'll find R Markdowns from the coding demos in class each day.

For Day 1 (introduction), there is also a companion guide with more context and exercises. If you missed the first lesson or it was entirely new material, we encourage you to have a look before Day 2!
